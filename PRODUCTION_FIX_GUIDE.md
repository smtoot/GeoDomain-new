# Production Issues Fix Guide

## üö® Current Issues
1. **No domains showing on public site** - Production database is not seeded
2. **Demo users not working** - Authentication issues in production

## üîß Root Causes
- Production database is empty (not seeded)
- Environment variables may be missing in production
- Database connection issues in production environment

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Fix
The production deployment issue has been resolved by fixing the SSR error in the test-login page.

### Step 2: Seed Production Database
Run the production seeding script to populate the database:

```bash
# In production environment
node seed-production.js
```

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in production:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your_production_database_url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-production-domain.com"
```

### Step 4: Test Demo Accounts
After seeding, test these demo accounts:

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@geodomainland.com`
- Password: `admin123`

**Seller Account:**
- Email: `seller1@test.com`
- Password: `seller123`

**Buyer Account:**
- Email: `buyer1@test.com`
- Password: `buyer123`

## üìä Expected Results After Fix

### Public Site (Browse Domains)
- Should show 8+ domains with prices
- Domains should be categorized by state/city
- Search and filtering should work
- "Found X domains" should show actual count

### Demo User Login
- All demo accounts should work
- Users should be redirected to appropriate dashboards
- Session persistence should work correctly

### Dashboard Functionality
- Seller dashboard should show domains and inquiries
- Buyer dashboard should show saved domains and purchases
- Admin dashboard should show system overview

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve production issues - seed database and fix demo users

- Fixed SSR error in test-login page
- Created production database seeding script
- Added comprehensive demo data (users, domains, inquiries)
- Fixed environment variable configuration
- Resolves 'no domains' and 'demo users not working' issues"

# 2. Push to production
git push origin main

# 3. After deployment, seed the production database
# (Run this in production environment)
node seed-production.js
```

## üîç Verification Checklist

- [ ] Production deployment succeeds (no build errors)
- [ ] Public site shows domains (not "No domains found")
- [ ] Demo user login works for all account types
- [ ] Seller dashboard shows domains and inquiries
- [ ] Buyer dashboard shows saved domains
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows system overview
- [ ] Search and filtering work on public site
- [ ] Domain details pages load correctly

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If domains still don't show:
1. Check if `seed-production.js` ran successfully
2. Verify database connection in production
3. Check if domains have `status: 'VERIFIED'`
4. Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### If demo users still don't work:
1. Verify user accounts were created in database
2. Check password hashing is working
3. Verify NextAuth configuration
4. Check session handling in production

### If deployment fails:
1. Check for TypeScript errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check build logs for specific errors
4. Ensure environment variables are configured

## üìû Support
If issues persist after following this guide, check:
1. Production logs for specific error messages
2. Database connection status
3. Environment variable configuration
4. NextAuth session handling
