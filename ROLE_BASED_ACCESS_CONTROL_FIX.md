# Role-Based Access Control Fix: Dashboard Pages

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
BUYER users were seeing seller-specific functionality in their dashboard, including:
- "Add Domain" buttons and forms
- "My Domains" management interface
- Seller inquiry management
- Wholesale domain management

This was confusing and inappropriate for users with BUYER role.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Pages Protected with Role-Based Access Control:**

#### **1. `/dashboard/domains` - Seller Domain Management**
- **Purpose**: Manage seller's domain listings
- **Access**: SELLER role only
- **Redirects**: 
  - BUYER → `/dashboard/saved` (their saved domains)
  - ADMIN → `/admin` (admin dashboard)

#### **2. `/dashboard/inquiries` - Seller Inquiry Management**
- **Purpose**: Manage inquiries received on seller's domains
- **Access**: SELLER role only
- **Redirects**:
  - BUYER → `/dashboard/saved` (they don't manage seller inquiries)
  - ADMIN → `/admin` (admin dashboard)

#### **3. `/dashboard/wholesale` - Seller Wholesale Management**
- **Purpose**: Manage wholesale domain listings
- **Access**: SELLER role only
- **Redirects**:
  - BUYER → `/dashboard/saved` (they don't manage wholesale)
  - ADMIN → `/admin` (admin dashboard)

### **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Role Checking Logic:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (status === 'authenticated' && session?.user) {
    const role = (session.user as any).role;
    setUserRole(role);
    
    // Redirect buyers to appropriate page
    if (role === 'BUYER') {
      router.push('/dashboard/saved');
      return;
    }
    
    // Redirect admins to admin dashboard
    if (role === 'ADMIN' || role === 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
      router.push('/admin');
      return;
    }
  }
}, [session, status, router]);
```

#### **Loading States:**
- **Authentication Loading**: Shows spinner while checking user role
- **Redirection Loading**: Shows spinner while redirecting to appropriate page
- **Prevents Flash**: No flash of wrong content before redirect
