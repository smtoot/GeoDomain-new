# States and Cities Navigation Fix

## Issue Resolved

### **Problem Identified**
Users could not find states and cities management in the admin dashboard. The pages existed but were not easily accessible through the navigation.

### **Root Cause**
The admin navigation had a "Categories & Locations" link that only pointed to `/admin/categories` (categories management), but the separate states (`/admin/states`) and cities (`/admin/cities`) management pages were not directly linked in the navigation.

## Technical Changes Made

### **1. Added Direct Navigation Links**
- **Added**: "States Management" navigation item pointing to `/admin/states`
- **Added**: "Cities Management" navigation item pointing to `/admin/cities`
- **Updated**: "Categories & Locations" renamed to "Categories Management" for clarity

### **2. Enhanced Navigation Icons**
- **States Management**: Uses `MapPin` icon from Lucide React
- **Cities Management**: Uses `Building2` icon from Lucide React
- **Categories Management**: Keeps existing `Tag` icon

### **3. Improved Navigation Structure**
- **Before**: Single "Categories & Locations" link (misleading)
- **After**: Three separate, clear navigation items:
  - Categories Management
  - States Management  
  - Cities Management

## Before vs After

### **Before (Confusing)**
```javascript
{
  name: 'Categories & Locations',
  href: '/admin/categories',
  icon: Tag,
  description: 'Manage domain categories, states, and cities',
  category: 'system'
}
// ❌ Only linked to categories, states/cities were hidden
```

### **After (Clear)**
```javascript
{
  name: 'Categories Management',
  href: '/admin/categories',
  icon: Tag,
  description: 'Manage domain categories',
  category: 'system'
},
{
  name: 'States Management',
  href: '/admin/states',
  icon: MapPin,
  description: 'Manage US states and territories',
  category: 'system'
},
{
  name: 'Cities Management',
  href: '/admin/cities',
  icon: Building2,
  description: 'Manage cities within states',
  category: 'system'
}
// ✅ Three separate, clear navigation items
```
