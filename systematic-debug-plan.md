# Systematic Debug Plan for Domain Details Page

## Phase 1: Data Flow Analysis
1. **Frontend Request**: How is the domain ID being passed from domains list to details page?
2. **URL Structure**: What does the actual URL look like when accessing domain details?
3. **tRPC Call**: What parameters are being sent to the getById endpoint?
4. **Backend Processing**: Is the getById endpoint receiving and processing the request correctly?
5. **Database Query**: Is the Prisma query finding the domain in the database?
6. **Response Structure**: What is the actual response structure being returned?
7. **Frontend Processing**: How is the response being processed and displayed?

## Phase 2: Verification Steps
1. **Verify Domain IDs**: Check what domain IDs actually exist in the database
2. **Test Direct API Call**: Test the getById endpoint directly with known domain IDs
3. **Check Response Format**: Verify the exact response structure from the API
4. **Trace Data Flow**: Follow the data from database → API → frontend → UI

## Phase 3: Potential Root Causes
1. **ID Mismatch**: Domain IDs in database don't match what's being passed
2. **API Endpoint Issues**: getById endpoint not working correctly
3. **Data Access Pattern**: Frontend not extracting data correctly from response
4. **Caching Issues**: Cached data causing problems
5. **Database Connection**: Database not accessible or query failing
6. **Authentication**: User permissions preventing access to domain data

## Phase 4: Testing Strategy
1. **Create Test Endpoints**: Build simple test endpoints to isolate issues
2. **Add Comprehensive Logging**: Log every step of the data flow
3. **Test with Known Data**: Use specific domain IDs that we know exist
4. **Compare Working vs Non-Working**: Compare with other working endpoints
